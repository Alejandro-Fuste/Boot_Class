                <h2>Biography</h2>
            
                <p>
                    This fanpage is a tribute to my favorite band, Tool. Formed in 1990, 
                   Tool is american rock band. Hailing from Los Angeles, California, 
                   the band's primary lineup since 1995 has been drummer; Danny Carey, guitarist; Adam Jones, 
                   vocalist; Maynard James Keenan and bassist Justin Chancellor. Due to Tool's incorporation 
                   of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a 
                   style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock.

                   Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping 
                   he charts in several countries. the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one 
                   box set. They emerged with a heavy metal sound in their first studio album, Undertow (1993), 
                   and they became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their
                   follow-up album Ã†nima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual 
                   arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days 
                   (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio 
                   album, Fear Inoculum, their first in thirteen years, was released on August 30, 2019 
                   to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold over 13 million 
                   albums in the US alone.
